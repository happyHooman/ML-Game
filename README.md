# ML-Game
[Preview](http://bb.assist.ro/biker-game/)


We wanted to practice our AI skills so we have decided to make a simple game with 2 inputs. 
The idea of the game is inspired from the Google Chrome browser dino game when in offline mode. 
The technology used is HTML5 <canvas\> element and plain ES6 Javascript. 
During game development we also have tried to use best practices and make a clean, easy to understand, and maintainable
code.

Please feel free to advise any improvements. Can't wait to get as smart as you are!
